### Hi there 👋


- ⚡ I know things about **compiler construction, language runtime internals, operating systems and databases** (a.k.a. “deep back-end stuff”).
- 🏣 I currently help the folk at [Cockroach Labs](https://cockroachlabs.com), the creators of [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach),
  with leadership things, architecture things, engineering culture and some code janitorial duties.
- ✨ What I try to do best:
  - seeing the present as it is, and the future as it should be,
  - improving projects, situations, myself,
  - leading by example, teaching and being a good friend.
- 💬 Ask me about power dynamics, management, unix, the history of computing, and art in video games.
- 🌱 Main hobby: help other folk's projects grow. Latest discovery: [Charm](https://charm.sh) and [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) 💖!
- 🎥 I try to stream some programming weekly over on Twitch: https://twitch.tv/kena42. Come hang out every Friday!
- 🔗 Check out my website for blog posts and more! [https://dr-knz.net/](https://dr-knz.net/archives/)
- 🐦 Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kena42
- 🏠 I live near Amsterdam in The Netherlands, but I travel a lot.

Glad to see you here!
