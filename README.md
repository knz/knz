### Hi there 👋

- ⚡ I know things about **compiler construction, language runtime internals, operating systems and databases** (a.k.a. “deep back-end stuff”).
- 🏣 I have helped the folk at [Cockroach Labs](http://cockroachlabs.com), the creators of [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach),
  quite a bit with leadership things, architecture things, engineering culture and some code janitorial duties.
- ✨ What I try to do best:
  - seeing the present as it is, and the future as it should be,
  - improving projects, situations, myself,
  - leading by example, teaching and being a good friend.
- 💬 Ask me about power dynamics, management, unix, the history of computing, and art in video games.
- 🌱 Main hobby: [break the ice](https://breaktheice.social).
- ⚒ In case you're interested, see [the tools of the trade](workspace.md).

- 🏠 I live near Amsterdam in The Netherlands, but I travel a lot.

Glad to see you here!
