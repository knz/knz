### Hi there 👋

- ⚡ I have built wide and deep technical expertise about **compilers, operating systems and databases** (a.k.a. “deep back-end stuff”). Passing to fluent expertise with C, C++, Python, Go and Rust.
- 🏣 I have helped the folk at [Cockroach Labs](http://cockroachlabs.com), the creators of [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach) and [Neon](https://neon.tech), the creators of [Neon (Serverless Postgres)](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon) with leadership, architecture, engineering culture and innumerable complex projects. (10 years)
- 🏣 In a previous life I also had a long and accomplished career as a scientific researcher and university lecturer. (also 10 years; PhD in computer architecture)
- 💬 Passionate about: product design, management, coaching, unix, dignified living, international tax treaties, the history of computing, snowboarding and art in video games.
- ✨ What I try to do best:
  - seeing the present as it is, and the future as it should be,
  - improving projects, situations, myself,
  - leading by example, teaching and being a good friend.
- 🕔 I tend to work on US-East office hours.
